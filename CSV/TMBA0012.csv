2012-08-31,,"Chassis built up and wired up, including RIG board, waiting for rest of circuit boards to be made."
2013-06-04,,"Installed NEW circuit boards, MET, Serial, and CPU board. "
2013-06-04,,"Installed new firware version 1.12, 130306.  All data inputs tested okay.  RF modem tested okay. Formated new 2GB Flash Ram Card."
2013-06-27,17:00,Started current drain test with all sensors in Doghouse outside
2013-07-01,17:40,"Stopped current drain test.  Ave current = 16.17mA.  Had two 6 hour Iridium buffers missing, that did not transmit."
2014-02-10,,Removed solder bridge shorting of JP24 on back of CPU board.  This removes the battery power inputs to A/D circuit on J12 from powering the CPU board.
2014-02-11,22:45,"Started Lake test in Buoy, testing firmware version 1.12, 140211, full MET sensor suite, plus 5 subsurface sensors: SSTC, TC, Aquadopp, T, and TP."
2014-02-24,00:30,Connected Monitoring computer to capture test date in a log file
2014-02-25,00:00,Rain Gauge Failed on TEST buoy in boat basin?  Std Dev of Rain Rate went from near zero to 100-200 counts.
2014-04-14,21:51,Swapped Failed Rain 764 with NEW replacement Rain 1642 on TEST buoy in Boat Basin
2014-05-06,,Successfully updated cal file with Rain 1642 via Iridium command
2014-05-12,,"2nd Rain gauge, sn1642 failed on TFLEX0012 TEST, data reading 1E+35."
2014-07-28,21:23,"Swapped Rain gauge (3rd one) Installed sn 1262, swapped out 1642 where data read 1E+35 continuously."
2014-07-28,,"Rain gauges, 674 & 1642 both bench tested okay (post-swap), so the failure must be with the Rain channel on the TFLEX circuit board (MET board?)"
2014-08-22,,"ENDED Buoy test in boat basin, XMIT battery voltage low, no more Iridium call ins."
2015-06-01,,"FAILED on IO1-15a, NO COMS.  I had case sitting on deck during IO1 cruise, it might have rolled and knocked something off circuit board???"
2016-08-15,,"Swapped in NEW CPU board (OLD CPU BOARD draws high current, around 27mA).  This fixed coms, but current drain still high, reading 38mA, instead of 8-12mA, terminal mode, quiesent current.  Needs further testing."
2017-01-10,,"Ryan wells fixed this system while I was on cruise travel for IO5-16(Jan 2017).  His comment tag says that he swapped the CPU and MET boards.  He also did a current drain test, resulting in 15.8mA average."
2017-02-15,,Changed the Rain shield ground wiring from seawater ground to Pin 1 power ground.  Also cut off the power jumper between the wind and compass connectors on the connector board (since its not needed).
2018-10-25,,"Back from sea, Rec IO2-18-RB.  Deployed for one year on RT-016, 8S-67E.  This system had 3 resets during its deployment?"
2018-12-03,,Installed metal SS standoffs on bottom of circuit board stack.
2018-12-03,,"Upgraded to v2.01, 170530 firmware."
2018-12-03,,Changed Iridium 1st transmit time to 00:45. (note: can't use 00:35)
2018-12-10,,"Ran benchtop current drain test for 5 days, 14.7mA average.  Flash RAM data dump okay."
2018-12-10,,Successfully tested XMIT and GPS commands outside on internal antennas.
2018-12-10,,Found the black dummy bulkhead on the faceplate loose.  Replaced it with a new one.
2018-12-10,,"Installed NEW O-rings, both Jam seal and face seal."
