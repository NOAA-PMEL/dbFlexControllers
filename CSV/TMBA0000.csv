2010-11-18,16:20,Tried restarting system via Iridium call at 0000Z (16:00 local).  No carrier
2010-11-21,,System brought into lab.  Burning in an older firmware version
2010-11-22,,Burned in V1.10 100514 PAPA VERSION (due to failure of v1.11 100813)
2010-11-22,,System back out to test stand. All sensors plugged into face plate.  DID NOT apply power.
2010-11-22,22:06,"Powered up system- NO RF, Tried connecting directly to term.  NO COMMS  Batteries?????  Left connected to battery.  Will try different battery Nov 23."
2010-12-02,17:30,"Tried to establish coms with TFLEX0000, no response, brought inside for check-out. Gave to Pat to reload firmware."
2010-12-06,22:00,"System would not respond because of Flash card.  Flash card had to be removed and reformatted with watchdog timer disabled(jumper removed).  Pat also updated firmware to v1.12 101206, which fixes Sparton compass problem with v 1.10 100514."
2010-12-07,00:00,"START of TESTING for firmware v1.12 101206 with full set of deployment sensors.  XMIT, GPS, ALL sensors working, put in LOG mode."
,18:00,"Stopped testing.  Brought inside lab.  Pat wants to revert back to the firmware version that is one version before the version that failed.  v1.11 100813 failed, the version before that is v1.11 100805.  Pat installed version 1.11100805 into system 0000."
,19:20,"ReSTARTED TESTING in LOG mode, now with firmware version 1.11 100805. XMIT, GPS, ALL sensors tested and working."
2010-12-08,23:00,"Data from RF modem putting out control characters at time in Tera Term, but not in XCTU terminal program.  Installed older version of TeraTerm, but control characters still being displayed (but not all RF modem data on screen).  Not sure if it's a TeraTerm problem or System RF modem problem."
2010-12-09,23:50,Pat accidentally reset this System 0000 via the RF modem.  RESTARTED.
2010-12-10,19:30,RESET and configured RF modem ID to 4 (per Pat's suggestion) because of the garbage control character data coming out of RF modem.  RESTARTED testing in LOG mode.
,20:10,"Not picking up data on RF modem address 4.  RESET again, set back to RF ID 0."
2010-12-13,17:20,Stopped Logging to fix RF modem.  REPLACED RF MODEM on System 0000.
,18:35,"ReSTATARED testing in LOG mode with new RF modem, RF ID = 4."
2011-01-05,23:00,Noticed that XMIT (Iridium) Battery Voltage data reading 0 in data.  Pat says some resistors need to be added to the CPU board to fix this. TO DO after testing.
2011-01-27,23:55,STOPPED TEST. Brought TFLEX0000 can inside to fix xmit battery voltage. Found Bat voltage connector loose.  Re-connected and now both battery voltage data working.
