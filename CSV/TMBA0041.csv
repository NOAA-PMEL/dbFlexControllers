2016-09-15,,Completed build up of NEW system sn 0041.  Tested all sensor inputs successfully.  RF modem tested okay.  
2016-09-22,,Installed new Iridium SIM card. Successfully tested GPS and XMIT functions with roof-mounted antennas connected inside lab.
2016-10-03,,"Ran Current drain test for 4.5 days, 13.94mA Average.  Dumped FLASH RAM data file, which looked okay."
,,Need to run GPS and XMIT test with system antennas (not roof antennas).
2016-12-20,,"Matt Casari borrowed this system to test the new Ocean Server compass board, but applied power incorrectly to the system.  Now its current drain is about 20mA high."
2017-02-23,,"Replaced CPU board.  Current drain reduced, but still a bit high about 4mA high.  All sensors work, so running current drain test."
2017-02-27,,"Benchtop Current drain test is a little high, but acceptable at 22.25mA after 4 days testing.  Transmitted data looked okay."
2017-03-21,,"Used this system to check transmit times for Dan Dougherty, and found that SSTC data not working in LOG mode data, reading 1E+35, but SSTC data works okay in the TEST mode SSTC command in the Terminal mode.  Needs to be fixed."
