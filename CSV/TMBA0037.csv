,,Need to run GPS and XMIT test with system antennas (not roof antennas).
2016-12-09,,"Put TFLEX0037 outside on test for PI3-17-AN (Brazil).  Everything worked except the Hygroclip ATRH.  The sensor was okay, so ohmed out ATRH IO pins to the MET board, which all looked okay.  So, swapped in a NEW MET board, which fixed the Hygro ATRH."
2018-08-03,,"DAMAGED on PT016, 4N-38W, mooring broke free, Vandalized?  Brasilians reported corrosion inside TFLEX on circuit boards?  No FLASH RAM data?  Brasilians could not dump data.  NEED TO GIVE FLASH CARD TO Dan to dump entire card to look for any data."
