2012-03-05,,"Tested all sensor inputs successfully, except inductive modem, which will not work with IMM version 1.14.  NEEDS IMM v1.12.  Also installed new sim card into Iridium modem."
2012-03-06,,Installed new IMM with v1.12 firmware.  Inductive circuit tested good after INITIMM command sent.
2012-03-07,,XMIT & GPS tests good outside in Dog house.
2012-03-08,,"Did 3 day current drain test, 17mA ave recorded (with RF modem powered OFF)."
2012-03-19,,Started current drain test with all sensors connected.
2012-03-29,,Ended current drain test with all sensors.  Average current drain = 22.15mA.
2013-02-04,,"Updated firmware to version 1.12, 130201"
2013-02-05,,"NEW in lab, needs testing for LW & SW in log mode."
2015-03-27,,"Replaced MET board, U1, U2, & U40 wrong brand, not TI chips? Plus swapped MET bd to fix LW & SW issue, no data in LOG mode."
2015-03-27,,"Updated CPU R4 to 887 Ohms, removed solder bridge on CPU JP24, and updated firmware to ver 1.12, 150313."
2015-04-06,,"Did 3 day current drain test with all sensors in the doghouse, 13.86mA ave recorded (with RF modem powered OFF).  Flash RAM data good.  SW & LW data good."
2015-08-03,,Shipped for PI3-15
2017-06-08,,Updated Rain shield ground to power ground.  Removed jumped wire between Pin7-Pin7 Power on Compass and wind sensor.
2017-06-08,,Updated Iridium 1st call time to 00:42
2017-06-09,,"Successfully tested all MET sensor inputs, RF modem, IM data, GPS, and Iridium XMIT.  Needs current drain re-check."
2017-06-13,,"Ran current drain test, 14.77mA average over 3 days."
2017-09-14,,"Changed firmware to version 1.16, 161014, O2 version for PNE, PI4-17-RB cruise."
2017-11-17,,"PI4-17-RB Cruise delayed. Re-tasked 0008 for PI1-18-TH.  Changed firmware to v2.01, 170530."
