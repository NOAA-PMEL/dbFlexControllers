2016-06-13,,Completed build up of NEW system sn 0024.  Tested all sensor inputs successfully.  RF modem tested okay.  Installed new Iridium SIM card. Successfully tested GPS and XMIT functions with roof-mounted antennas connected inside lab.
2016-06-22,,"Setup Config by mistake, that did  6min Iridium calls and 6min GPS fixes.  Data did not work and system reset 4 times.  After config properly setup, then ran Current drain test for 4 days, but Mulit-meter showed error, so had to restart test.  Finally got 2 day current drain average of 14.22mA.  Dumped Flash RAM data,which looked okay."
,,Need to run GPS and XMIT test with system antennas (not roof antennas).
