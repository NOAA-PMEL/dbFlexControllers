2010-09-20,16:00,"Noticed that this TFLEX unit, 0002, was only getting GPS position updates sporadically while set to every 6 hours, so will try to change it to once per day.  Pat says this could be because it's testing outside of Bldg 3, and the building is interfering with GPS satellite reception."
2010-09-20,21:00,"Reset, took out of LOG mode, updated Configuration to set ""GPS Interval"" from every 6 hours to 24 hours (once/day).  Also updated ""GPS set time"" to 12:15.  Then put back into LOG mode."

2010-12-13,22:45,"ReStarted TESTING in LOG mode, v1.12 101206. (see above for sensors)"
2011-01-26,18:00,"Disconnected inductive test cable, NO inductive sensors connected. Brought sensors inside to prep for PI2-10 cruise shipment."
2011-01-28,17:05,STOPPED TEST. Brought Can inside to upgrade firmware to 1.11 100805.

2011-06-27,17:30,Stopped test for PI1-11-RB.
2011-06-27,,Pat is doing a current drain test of this system 0002 out in the dog house outside.
2011-06-28,,"Pat finished with current drain testing, resulting in 24hr average of 17mA."
2011-07-07,,Shipped as Spare for PI1-11.
2011-09-08,,"Air shipped back from PI1-11, Cape Town"

2012-12-29,,"Deployed at 12N-90E on IO7-12-SN, RT002"
2013-06-04,,"FAILED, stopped transmitting at 12N-90E, RT002."
2013-06-06,,"The TFLEX system at 12n90e (TFLEX-1002, deployment RT-002) started to report system resets on May 29 after about 150 days of problem-free operation. The Hygroclip AT/RH data ended after the first reset, and other sensors came back online with some data loss, as has been the observed pattern in other FLEX/TFLEX systems.  Several more resets occurred on June 4.  There have been no dialin calls for about the last 48 hours (last was 20123-06-04 19:00)."
2014-05-08,,"TFLEX0002 finally shipped back from India.  Failure of TFLEX0002 caused by Hygroclip 60194533 failure.  Somehow saltwater got into the pigtail interconnection cable, RMG-4-MP male pins, which corroded and shorted out system."
2014-05-09,,Did a bench-top current drain test of system with no sensors connected inside lab.  Currrent drain average was 6.3mA.
2015-04-30,,Found Serial board missing Q2 & Q5 with jumpers shorted?  So replaced Serial board.
2015-04-30,,Changed R4 to 887Ohms and removed solder bridge on JP24 on CPU board.
2015-04-30,,"Upgraded Firmware to version 1.12, 150313."
2015-11-29,,"FAILED on RT002, at 12N-90E.  Hygroclip cable not sealed (pigtail to interconnection connector), so saltwater leaked in and shorted out, shorting out TFLEX electronics.  System works, but has a high current drain."
2015-05-01,,"Tried to do a current drain inside the lab, 1st time with roof-mounted antennas, but this system has a higher than expected current drain at around 60mA.  More boards need to be replaced."
