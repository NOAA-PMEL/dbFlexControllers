2013-07-01,18:00,Started current drain test with all sensors in Doghouse outside
2013-07-02,17:15,Ave current drain = 15.2mA
2013-07-03,19:40,Ave current drain = 15.48mA
2013-07-08,17:45,Stopped current drain test.  Ave current = 15.37mA
2014-05-05,,"Installed re-worked MET board with changes to U1, U2, U40.  Also removed JP24 solder bridge on CPU bd.  Plus updated firmware to v1.12, 140211."
2015-03-20,,"Updated CPU R4 to 887 Ohms, and updated firmware to ver 1.12, 150313."
2015-08-15,,Used for Gill All-in-one sensor TEST at Grassy Knoll

2017-08-07,,"Did post deploy (Rec PI2-17-TH, PT-006, 0-23W) current drain test, 15.38mA average over 4 days."
2017-09-14,,"Changed firmware to version 1.16, 161014, O2 version for PNE, PI4-17-RB cruise."
2017-09-14,,"Unfortunately, I mixed up the serial and met ribbon cables and plugged them into the wrong boards.  Iridium Xmit now has problems, sometimes it works, sometimes says bad Iridium coms.  When it works it is slow and hangs at times.  May have to swap the Iridium modem, or serial board.  F*&$k!"
2017-11-06,,"Upgraded to firmware version 2.01, 170530.  Tested on bench again, iridium coms and XMIT working okay now???  Will run current drain/bench test with roof-top antennas"
